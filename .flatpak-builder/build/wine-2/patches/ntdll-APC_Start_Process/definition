Fixes: Process APC calls before starting process
Disabled: true

# This patch is for an old snapshot build of Cygwin. It was originally posted
# in bug 24018, and a more detailed description is in bug 34865:

#
# Basic summary: user APCs which are queued in DllMain and in TLS callbacks
# need to be executed after all dlls are loaded and loader lock is released
# but before process entry.
# It broke due to recent reworking of the loader code. Alistair tried to rebase
# it but, with no explanation of the bug, did it incorrectly.
# The bug is potentially still valid (as given by comment 13 of the first link)
# so I'm not going to remove it. However, there is almost surely no application
# that needs it, so I have disabled it and removed all dependences on it.
