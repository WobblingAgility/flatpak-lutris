Contributing to Wine Staging
----------------------------

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project.

### Reporting bugs

Since WineConf 2015 Wine Staging is an official part of WineHQ, which means you
can report problems directly at [bugs.winehq.org](https://bugs.winehq.org/).
Most of the time bugs found in Wine Staging also turn out to be present in the
development branch, so its recommended to open your bug in the "Wine" product,
unless you are sure its really "Wine Staging" specific. For bugs related to our
binary packages, please open a bug report in the "Packaging" product.

### Submitting patches

**IMPORTANT:** Please use [dev.wine-staging.com](https://dev.wine-staging.com/patches)
for patch submissions, we currently do not accept Pull requests on GitHub.

Wine Staging mainly concentrates on experimental features and patches which are
difficult to get into the development branch. If you have a very simple bug fix
including tests, there is usually no need to send it to Wine Staging. You can
directly contribute it to the
[development branch](http://wiki.winehq.org/SubmittingPatches). However, if you
already tried that without success, or are working on such a complex area that
you do not really think its ready for inclusion, you might want to submit it to
our Staging tree. Please open a patch submission request on
[dev.wine-staging.com](https://dev.wine-staging.com/patches) including the patch.
More information is also available in our
[Wiki](https://wiki.winehq.org/Wine-Staging_Patches).
